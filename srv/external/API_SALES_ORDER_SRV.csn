If the unit of measure of the conditions basis differs from the unit of measure of the price condition (condition unit), the system automatically converts it into the unit of measure of the condition unit. For calculation types C, M, N, O, and P, the item quantity is the default value for the condition basis.For several calculation types (for example, A, B, H, I, J, K, W), the condition basis is a currency field and refers to a currency key field. Such a currency field in the context of pricing is called currency amount. If the currency key of the conditions basis (currency amount) differs from the currency key of the document, the system automatically converts the condition basis (currency amount) into the currency of the document.

If the currency key of the conditions basis (currency amount) differs from the currency key of the document, the system automatically converts the condition basis (currency amount) into the currency of the document. The system uses the exchange rates for the currencies that are defined in the general settings for currencies.Note: The standard number of decimal places for a currency is two.Currencies that use a different number of decimal places must in addition be entered into table TCURX, where you can explicitly define the number of decimal places, for example, zero decimals for Japanese yen JPY.Deviations are preconfigured depending on the currency, for example, zero decimals for Japanese yen JPY.If you have defined scales, the system uses the condition basis to determine the valid scale line with the corresponding condition amount.In usage-based pricing models, the usage corresponds to the condition basis.The condition basis can be aQuantityWeightVolumeCurrency AmountA sales order includes an item with a quantity of 120 pieces:The determined list price of USD 101 (condition amount) multiplied with the quantity of 120 pieces (condition basis) results in a condition value of USD 12120.Two discounts are applied to the item of this sales order:The first discount (-1 USD / PC) is based on the quantity ordered that is the condition basis equals the item quantity and the result is - 120 USD.The second discount (- 2 %) is calculated as a percentage which is applied to the results of the list price (USD 12120) and the first discount (- 120 USD).
